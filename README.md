======

"stomp.py" is a Python client library for accessing messaging servers (such as ActiveMQ, Apollo or RabbitMQ) using the [STOMP protocol](http://stomp.github.io) (versions [1.0](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.0.html), [1.1](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.1.html) and [1.2](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html)). It can also be run as a standalone, command-line client for testing.


Quick Start
-----------

A basic example of using stomp.py can be found [here](https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/wiki/Simple-Example). Testing via the command-line interface is described [here](https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/wiki/Command-Line-Access).

Downloads can be found on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stomp.py).  
API documentation can be found [here](http://jasonrbriggs.github.io/stomp.py/index.html). Current test coverage can be found [here](http://jasonrbriggs.github.io/stomp.py/htmlcov/).

[Version 4.0+](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stomp.py) is for both Python2.x and Python3.x - with support for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 of the protocol.

stomp.py has been perfunctorily tested on: [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/), [Apollo](http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/), [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com), [stompserver](http://stompserver.rubyforge.org), and has been reported to work with [JBossMessaging](http://www.jboss.org/jbossmessaging) in the distant past. 
For more info on setting up the test server (using virtualbox), contact the developer.
