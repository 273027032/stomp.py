Introduction to Stomp.py
========================

About Stomp.py
--------------

Stomp.py started as a library to test inject messages (via the `stomp protocol <https://stomp.github.io>`_ version 1.0) to a message broker (used for inter-application communications in a telecommunications platform), predominately for performance testing. In the 8 or 9 years since its inception, support for the next versions of the protocol has been added, and the command line client has been significantly enhanced.

* Stomp.py supports all versions of the stomp protocol (1.0, 1.1 and 1.2)
* Command-line client installed via pip
* Perfunctorily tested on: ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, stompserver, and has been reported to work with JBossMessaging in the distant past. Full test suite running against Apache Apollo (for info on setting up VirtualBox for testing, contact the developer).
